Templating - Thymeleaf 

Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for web or standalone environments, whichis capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and even plain text. 

Thymeleaf can be integrated into Spring Framework and for this I need to add thymeleaf dependencies to the Maven POM file. 
 
The HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS are in the templates in the resources. 

The java code is structured according to MVC prinzip. In model part are the data objects included. The data object are created by using lombok. 

The controller part use @Controller of Springframework, RequestMapping to enable to navigation to the corresponding side.

For thymeleaf loops we use @ModelAttribute including a corresponding Stringexpression (e.g. @ModelAttribute("message"), which will be used after the url). 

We run the tymeleafApplication as @SpringBootApplication.
